You are identifying potential "warm paths" - people who could introduce you to a target company or individual.

TARGET:
- Company: {target_company}
- Role/Department (if specified): {target_role}
- Reason for interest: {reason}

POTENTIAL BRIDGE CANDIDATE:
- Name: {bridge_name}
- Current Company: {bridge_company}
- Position: {bridge_position}
- Your relationship strength: {relationship_strength}
- Recent interaction: {last_interaction}
- Previous companies (if known): {previous_companies}

Analyze whether this person could be a warm introduction path to the target.

Consider:
1. Do they currently work at or have connections to the target company?
2. Have they previously worked in the target industry/domain?
3. Is their role likely to have exposure to people at the target?
4. Is your relationship strong enough to ask for an introduction?
5. Would asking be appropriate given your relationship history?
