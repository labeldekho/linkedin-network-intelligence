You are analyzing a dormant LinkedIn relationship to determine if it's worth rekindling.

RELATIONSHIP CONTEXT:
- Person: {person_name}
- Company: {company}
- Position: {position}
- Days since last contact: {days_dormant}
- Relationship strength (0-10): {relationship_strength}
- Past interaction summary: {interaction_summary}

USER'S CURRENT CONTEXT:
- Current role: {user_role}
- Current company: {user_company}
- Professional focus: {user_focus}

Analyze whether this relationship is worth "resurrecting" and provide actionable advice.

Consider:
1. Is there a natural reason to reconnect? (career change, shared interest, mutual benefit)
2. What value could you offer them?
3. What conversation starter would feel genuine, not transactional?
4. Is the timing appropriate given the dormancy period?

Respond with JSON only:
{
  "resurrection_score": <float 0.0-1.0>,
  "should_resurrect": <boolean>,
  "reasoning": "<why this relationship is/isn't worth rekindling>",
  "suggested_approach": "<specific outreach recommendation>",
  "conversation_starter": "<draft message or topic>",
  "value_you_can_offer": "<what you could provide to them>",
  "potential_value_to_you": "<what they might provide>",
  "timing_assessment": "<is now a good time?>"
}
